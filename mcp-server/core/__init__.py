Core Infrastructure Module

This folder contains the foundational infrastructure for the MCP server:

- db_utils.py: Database connection pooling for AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- secrets.py: AWS Secrets Manager integration for secure credential storage
- auth.py: JWT token validation and role-based access control
- audit.py: HIPAA-compliant audit logging for all patient data access

TODO: Implement these modules as you build out the MCP server
